# Vercel Build Fix

## Issue

Vercel build was failing with error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@react-email/render'
```

## Solution

Added `@react-email/render` as a dependency in `package.json`.

This package is a peer dependency required by Resend for rendering email templates.

## What Changed

**package.json:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@react-email/render": "^1.0.1",  // ← Added this
  "next": "15.5.5",
  "react": "19.1.0",
  "react-dom": "19.1.0",
  "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
  "resend": "^6.1.3"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the change:**
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Add @react-email/render dependency for Resend"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically:**
   - Detect the push
   - Install the new dependency
   - Build successfully
   - Deploy your site

3. **Monitor the build:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Watch the deployment logs
   - Should complete successfully now

## Why This Happened

Resend uses `@react-email/render` internally to render email templates. While it's listed as an optional peer dependency, Next.js Turbopack requires it to be explicitly installed.

## Verification

Once deployed, test:
- ✅ Site loads correctly
- ✅ Contact form works
- ✅ Emails are sent
- ✅ No build errors

The build should now complete successfully! 🎉
