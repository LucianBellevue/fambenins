## Changes Made

### 1. Footer Services Section

**Before:**
- Health Insurance
- Life Insurance
- ICHRA Solutions

- Dental & Vision

**After:**
- Health Insurance
- Life Insurance

### 2. Contact Form Coverage Type Dropdown

**Before:**
```
- Select coverage type

- ICHRA for Business
- Medicare
- Dental & Vision
- Multiple Types
```

**After:**
```

```

**Rationale:**

- Simplified to core offerings only

## Impact on User Experience

### Clearer Navigation
- ✅ **Focused service list** in footer
- ✅ **No redundancy** between ICHRA and Group Health
- ✅ **Core offerings only** - easier to understand

### Streamlined Contact Form
- ✅ **Fewer options** = faster completion
- ✅ **No confusion** about ICHRA vs Group Health
- ✅ **Conditional fields** still work perfectly

## Conditional Form Logic

The contact form still has smart conditional fields:

### When "Group Health Plan" is selected:
Shows:
- Business Name (required)
- Number of Employees (required)
- Business Address (required)

### When "Individual Health Plan" is selected:
Shows:
- Family Size (required)
- Currently Insured? (optional)
- Monthly Budget (optional)

### When "Life Insurance" or "Multiple Types" is selected:
Shows:
- Standard form (no additional fields)

## Site-Wide Consistency

All references now updated:

| Location | Old Label | New Label |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Header (Desktop) | ICHRA Solutions | Group Health |
| Header (Mobile) | ICHRA Solutions | Group Health |
| Footer Services | ICHRA Solutions | Group Health Solutions |
| Homepage Card | ICHRA Solutions | Group Health Solutions |
| Contact Form | ICHRA for Business | (Removed - use Group Health Plan) |

## Benefits of This Cleanup

2. **Faster decisions** - Fewer options to consider
3. **Better guidance** - Conditional fields help them provide right info

## Form Flow Examples

### Example 1: Small Business Owner
1. Selects "Group Health Plan"
2. Form shows: Business Name, # Employees, Address
3. Fills in: "ABC Bakery", "5 employees", "123 Main St"
4. Submits → Agent knows it's a small business group inquiry

### Example 2: Individual/Family
1. Selects "Individual Health Plan"
2. Form shows: Family Size, Currently Insured, Budget
3. Fills in: "Family of 4", "No", "$400-$600"
4. Submits → Agent knows it's individual/family inquiry

### Example 3: Life Insurance
1. Selects "Life Insurance"
2. No additional fields shown
3. Can add details in message field
4. Submits → Agent knows it's life insurance inquiry

## Technical Notes

### Form State Management
No changes needed to form state - all fields still exist:
```typescript
{
  coverageType: '',
  businessName: '',
  businessAddress: '',
  numberOfEmployees: '',
  familySize: '',
  currentlyInsured: '',
  budget: '',
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Conditional Rendering
Still works perfectly:
```tsx
{formData.coverageType === 'group-health' && (
  // Business fields
)}

{formData.coverageType === 'individual-health' && (
  // Individual/family fields
)}
```

## SEO Impact

### Positive Changes
- ✅ **Clearer site structure** - Group Health is comprehensive
- ✅ **Better internal linking** - All business solutions in one place
- ✅ **Focused content** - Core offerings only
- ✅ **Reduced confusion** - No duplicate/similar pages

### No Negative Impact
- ✅ **URL unchanged** - /ichra still works (now Group Health page)
- ✅ **Metadata updated** - Reflects new comprehensive focus
- ✅ **Navigation clear** - Easy to find all services

## Future Considerations

### If Adding New Services
When adding Medicare, Dental & Vision, or other services:

**Option 1: Separate Pages**
- Create dedicated pages
- Add to footer services
- Add to contact form dropdown

**Option 2: Sub-Services**
- Keep under main categories
- Add as sections on existing pages
- Don't clutter navigation

**Recommendation:** Keep navigation focused on 3-4 main offerings. Add others as sub-services or "Additional Services" section.
