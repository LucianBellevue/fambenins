                Insurance quotes provided through our services are estimates based on the information you

                and other factors determined by the insurance carrier.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">Applications</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Submitting an application through our services does not guarantee coverage. All applications 
                are subject to review and approval by the insurance carrier. The carrier may request additional 
                information, medical examinations, or documentation.

                We cannot guarantee that you will be approved for coverage or that any specific policy will 
                be available to you. Insurance carriers make final decisions on coverage and pricing.

                Our services are typically provided at no direct cost to you. We receive compensation from 
                insurance carriers in the form of commissions when you purchase a policy through us. This 
                compensation does not increase the cost of your insurance.
